            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>

            <p>My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. It’s never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this\ I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client.</p>

            <p>The schedule of a web designer differs when it comes to if they work at home or not, people who work at home can just wake up and start when they please and end their work whenever they want so they can have some flexibility. But if you work in a company you would work much more, it’s not clear the exact schedule or everyday routine because that also differs depending on where you work and what field of web designing you’re in.</p>
